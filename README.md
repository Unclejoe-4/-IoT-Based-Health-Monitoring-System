# -IoT-Based-Health-Monitoring-System
This project focuses on the design and simulation of an IoT-based health monitoring system developed using the Wokwi simulator and integrated with the ThingSpeak cloud platform. The system is built to continuously track key vital signs, including body temperature, humidity levels, and heart rate, ensuring that health data is monitored in real time.
